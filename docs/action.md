## Let it be maybe?

We often come across two philosophies: the first one emphasizes planning, prioritizing, measuring, and executing, while the second promotes letting things happen through effortless action. At first glance, these approaches may seem contradictory, but they are not. One can use both, and here's how: for things within your circle of control, apply the first philosophy; for those outside your circle of control, apply the second. What does this mean? The next time a challenge arises, whether personal or professional, simply ask: What are the inputs? What can I do to make things better? Then plan and execute those steps. For things you cannot control but still occupy your mind, let them be. No amount of energy spent thinking about them will help. Just wait.
