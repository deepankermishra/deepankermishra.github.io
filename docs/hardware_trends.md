## Hardware Leads the Way

At the core of technological evolution lies a simple truth: most transformative trends originate from hardware innovations. This essay explores how hardware advancements have catalyzed seismic shifts in technology, spawned software trends, and occasionally rendered them obsolete, all while reshaping our financial economies.

### Early Hardware Trends

The reduction in computer size marked the dawn of the personal computer era, with Apple emerging as a pioneer in making computers accessible to the masses. This hardware shift created an opportunity for software abstraction in the form of operating systems, with Microsoft becoming the dominant player in this space. The synergy between hardware and software innovations laid the foundation for the digital revolution we experience today.

As technology progressed, the introduction of touch screens and mobile devices, spearheaded by Apple, ushered in a new era of computing. This hardware trend led to the rise of mobile operating systems, with Android emerging as a major player alongside iOS. The proliferation of smart devices extended beyond phones to cars, TVs, and speakers, with Apple, Google, and Amazon dominating this space. This expansion demonstrates how hardware innovations can create entirely new markets and ecosystems.

The internet's foundation was laid by telecom companies establishing broadband networks and hardware manufacturers like Cisco building routers and switches. This hardware infrastructure paved the way for another powerful software abstraction: the web browser. This development led to the birth of numerous internet-based companies and fundamentally changed how we communicate, work, and access information.

The transition from Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) to Solid State Drives (SSDs) exemplifies how hardware advancements can render certain software optimizations obsolete. Traditional databases designed for HDDs' limitations became significantly faster with SSDs. As SSDs become more cost-effective, the extensive code developed to optimize HDD performance may become redundant, illustrating the constant interplay between hardware and software development. Similar trends have existed in the compute (CPU) world for very long.

Recent improvements in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have enabled the development of sophisticated software stacks for blockchain technology and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML). These advancements have also made autonomous driving more feasible, attracting both established companies and startups to the field. This demonstrates how hardware innovations can open up entirely new technological frontiers and business opportunities.

Most entrepreneurs who are able to foresee a future based on certain hardware improvements gain extreme popularity with Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jensen leading the way.

### The Longevity of Hardware-Driven Trends

Technology trends that originate from fundamental hardware improvements tend to have more longevity than purely software trends. Companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have successfully capitalized on both hardware and software trends, giving them a significant advantage in the tech landscape. These companies have the resources to invest in and adapt to emerging hardware trends, allowing them to maintain their dominance across multiple sectors.
In contrast, companies like Meta, Uber, and Coinbase, which primarily focus on software trends, may face limitations in their ability to adapt to all hardware trends. This distinction highlights the importance of having a foothold in both hardware and software development to ensure long-term success in the tech industry.

Meta tried to create a new hardware trend with augmented reality products that created an opportunity for yet another dominant software trend, however, it did not gain significant traction that also attracted some criticism for Mark. Meta also tried to capitalise on the [blockchain](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/01/tech/facebook-diem-association-dissolving/index.html) trend for a bit until completely pivoting its focus to AI.

However, there’s an emergent economy because of a major software trend called creator economy. It’s unclear how long this will last or if that is the future with AI doing all the work and humans mostly consuming content for entertainment. In this trend, Google and Meta have benefited from the creation of platforms that support content creators, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple have had to find alternative ways to engage with this trend, often through acquisitions (LinkedIn) or by developing their own content production capabilities (Prime Video and Apple TV+).

Ultimately, many of these companies rely on advertising and subscription-based models to monetize their platforms and services. This convergence of business models across different types of tech companies underscores the interconnectedness of the digital economy.

### The Concentration of Power and Its Implications

We are currently in an era where a small number of large tech companies dominate multiple markets. This concentration of power has both positive and negative implications for innovation and competition:
Acquisition opportunities: Startups and smaller companies can develop products or services with the potential to be acquired by larger tech firms, providing an exit strategy for entrepreneurs.
Competitive challenges: The market dominance of major players can make it difficult for new entrants to gain traction, potentially stifling innovation in certain areas.
Hybrid models: Some companies, like OpenAI, have found success by leveraging the research of larger firms (e.g., Google) while partnering with others (e.g., Microsoft) for enterprise solutions, demonstrating the potential for collaborative innovation.

Moreover, as these companies diversify they are able to tap on to more and more hardware trends, which in turn makes them bigger and more powerful. Most of these companies have experimental projects in space tech, quantum computing, etc. which can be significant future hardware trends.

### Conclusion

The interplay between hardware and software innovations continues to shape the technological landscape and, by extension, our economic systems. As we move forward, the companies that can successfully navigate both hardware and software trends are likely to maintain their dominant positions. However, the potential for disruption remains, whether through breakthrough technologies, regulatory changes, or the emergence of new local players that are servicing a specific geography or country. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for businesses, policymakers, and individuals seeking to thrive in an increasingly digital world.
